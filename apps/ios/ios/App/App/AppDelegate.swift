     * The two methods that carry the APNs device token from iOS to the plugin.
     *
     * Without them push does not fail loudly — it fails as silence. iOS calls
     * these on the app delegate, @capacitor/push-notifications listens for the
     * matching NotificationCenter posts, and the Capacitor template ships an
     * AppDelegate that implements neither. So `register()` succeeds, iOS gets a
     * token, and it is handed to a method nobody wrote. The `registration` event
     * never fires, the JS side waits out its timeout, and the settings screen
     * says "that did not work" with nothing anywhere to say why.
     *
     * Found on 2026-08-26 from a TestFlight build on a real iPad, which is the
     * only place it CAN be found: the Simulator never gets far enough to
     * produce a token, so every check before this one passed.
